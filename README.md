# MBA Python Group Project

This repository contains the final project for my University of Iowa MBA Python course. Our project explores the strategic patterns of investment advisory firms in the U.S. and their relationship to the distribution of high-net-worth clients.

##Project Description

Investment firms are pivotal in helping clients achieve long-term financial goals. Using Form ADV data from the SEC, we analyzed:

- How the distribution of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) varies by firm size, geographic location, and compensation model.
- What firm characteristics are most associated with the ability to attract and retain HNWI.
- Whether smaller firms specialize in niche strategies more than larger firms.
- Which U.S. regions show higher concentrations of firms serving HNWIs.

Our dataset includes 15,964 rows and 469 columns from February 2025.
